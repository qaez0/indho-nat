All such bets are subject to the relevant House Betting Rules applicable to each event or game, and to these Terms and Conditions. If a manifest error or mistake occurs or an incorrect participant is quoted for any event, all bets placed on that event shall be void. In the event of any malfunction to the 11ic gaming system, failed transmission or other technical issues or suspected fraud 11ic reserves the right to void any and/or all bets placed. Notwithstanding any other provision in these Terms and Conditions, 11ic reserves the right, in our absolute discretion, to decline all, or part, of any bet placed without providing any reason whatsoever. We only accept bets made through the internet and/or Devices in compliance with these Terms and Conditions. Bets are not accepted in any other form (whether by post, email, fax or otherwise) and where received will be void regardless of the outcome. Subject to the other provisions herein, bets will be deemed to be validly placed by you if your username and password have been entered correctly, subject always to there being sufficient available funds in your account. You are responsible and liable for all activities and transactions that take place through the use of any of the following (or any combination there of): your name; your account number; your username and password; regardless of whether the use of the foregoing was authorized by you or not. It is your sole responsibility to ensure that the details of your bets are correct and that you understand the terms of the bet registration including any rules applicable to the bet before you confirm placing of the bet and in this regard you may wish to review your bet for mistakes before it is transmitted to us. Subject to the other provisions herein, once your bets have been placed and their acceptance confirmed by us, they may not be canceled, revoked or changed by you and shall be deemed to be conclusive evidence in respect of the bets that you have placed. It should be noted that all bets are logged and recorded in the transaction log database. 11ic's transaction logs shall be conclusive evidence of all transactions and times at which the transactions are placed. Subject to the requirement for payment to be received by us prior to a bet being deemed to be placed (and if this is not received then we reserve the right to void the bet) and the other provisions herein, bets will be deemed valid and accepted by 11ic when a transaction ID is displayed on your screen and duly reflected in your transaction history. No betting is permitted after any deadline set by us, the commencement of an event and/or where the outcome of an event is known at the time of placement of your bet. If any event is erroneously left open for betting after the commencement of the event and/or where the outcome of an event is known, 11ic reserves the right to decline or void such bets placed without reference to you. Acceptance of any bet or any part thereof shall be at the sole discretion of 11ic. For the avoidance of doubt, this clause does not prohibit \"in play\" or \"half time\" bets where allowed by 11ic. Advertised start times of the events displayed on the Website(s) are for information purposes only. If for any reason a bet is inadvertently accepted by India after an event or match has commenced other than \"in play\" or \"half time\" bets where accepted by 11ic, 11ic reserves the right to cancel and void such bet. Unless stated otherwise within the rules for each sport or event, the result of a match or event will be determined on the day of its conclusion for betting purposes. Any subsequent enquiry that may result in an overturned decision will not be recognized by 11ic, and original settlement of bets will stand. If the venue for a sporting event is changed, all bets placed based on the original venue shall at the sole discretion of 11ic be voidable by us. The winner of an event or game will be determined on the date of the event's conclusion according to the House Betting Rules. 11ic does not recognize suspended games, protests or overturned decisions for betting purposes. Should you include a non-runner or void selection in a multiple bet, the bet will be settled on the remaining valid selections only. You acknowledge that any and all odds, lines and handicaps are subject to fluctuation without notice, and the foregoing will become fixed only at the time of acceptance of the bet by us. Where a manifest error, mistake or system failure deriving from 11ic results in an incorrect odd, line or handicap taken in a bet, the bet, or that part of the bet if it is a multiple bet/parlay sought to be placed with 11ic will be void. Provided the error, mistake or failure is rectified in time, 11ic may in our absolute discretion (but shall not be obliged to) make reasonable efforts to contact you to allow the choice of placing another bet at the correct odds, lines and handicaps. We will not accept any simultaneously placed bets on one event from you. In respect of any bet and the associated transactions therewith, the decision of 11ic is final and conclusive. When the player wishes to place a bet using Indonesian Rupiah, the player shall place his bet by eliminating the last three (3) zeros from his desired stake. All bets shall be in multiples of one thousand. For easy reference, please see the following examples: Once the player types the amount in accordance with the above mentioned rules, the system automatically recognizes that three (3) zeros shall be added to the amount of stake in order to determine the true amount of stake desired by the player. Customers must register their bet request as individuals. Repeated requests containing the same selections from the same or different customers may be subsequently deemed where we believe the customers are acting in collusion or as part of a syndicate and/or identical or similar bet requests are registered within a short time of each other and dealt with us accordingly."

Active Wagering Members refers to customers that reach a minimum wagering turnover amount equivalent to 5,000 rupees (PKR 5,000.00) each in any given calendar month. Commissionable Earnings are calculated as 11ic profit, less charge-back, complimentary money, free money offers and other incentives offered to the customer, derived from at least six (6) Active Wagering Members in a calendar month. Charge-back: A credit card holder discovers irregular transactions made on his/her Credit/Debit Card, which was not authorized by him/her. The credit card holder then requests his/her bank to reverse these charges. Charge backs relate to fraudulent use by a third party of the credit card holder's card or card number. \"India Gross Win\" is the total of all amounts bet by at least six (6) Active Wagering Members under your affiliate account in a calendar month, minus all amounts won by or paid to your Active Wagering Members. \"Charge-backs\" are amounts deducted when a customer that is a credit card holder discovers irregular unauthorized charge-backs made on the customer's Credit/Debit Card, and the credit card holder requests the bank to reverse these charges. Charge-backs may relate to, but are not limited to, fraudulent use by a third party of the credit card holder's card or card number. Should the player process a charge back, the disputed or charged-back revenue will be forfeited and therefore deducted from the total balance due to you for the current month. Should this deduction of the accumulated revenue exceed your current amount due, your balance will then revert to a negative balance, and you will have to earn revenue to cover the charge-back before you can start earning revenue again. A charge back will stay due until the revenue generated by your other players has covered the amount due. You acknowledge that 11ic can only pay out a percentage of their actual profits, not fraudulent revenue. \"Bonuses\" include complimentary money, free money offers, credits, sign-up bonuses, promotional amounts and other incentives credited to the account of customers. As customers have not actually purchased these amounts, 11ic cannot pay commissions on the same. Should you fail to be entitled to the Commissionable Earnings in accordance with Clauses 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 above for failure to maintain at least six (6) Active Wagering Members in a given month, you will not generate any commission in the month and the related member's lost will not be brought forward to the following months. Commissionable earnings will be subject to commissions as calculated using the 11ic Affiliate Program commission structure in force from time to time. Negative earnings are carried forward to the next month. Should the affiliate close the month with a positive balance, payment will be issued if it meets the minimum requirements and commissions will be paid on the positive balance. The Commissionable Earnings of the affiliate calculated based on commission structure will be earned on all transactions that the customer undertakes with the merchant, as long as the affiliate remains a member of this affiliate program. Affiliates will not earn any commission from a member's turnover or win/loss resulting from or connected with any horse racing and casino wagers using the 11ic website."
